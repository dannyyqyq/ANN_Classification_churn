## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn for a bank, helping businesses retain customers by identifying at-risk individuals. It leverages a dataset of customer records from a bank, processed with TensorFlow/Keras for classification. The project covers:

- **Data Ingestion**: Loading and preparing customer data from CSV files for analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Preprocessing and encoding categorical data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Training an ANN to classify customers as likely to churn or not.
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Applying the trained model to predict churn for new customer data.
- **Web Application**: A Streamlit-based interface for users to input customer data and get churn predictions.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for live access.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies Used

### ðŸš€ Deployment
- **Streamlit**: 
  - Provides an interactive web interface for real-time churn predictions.

### ðŸ“Š Machine Learning
- **Classification Model**: 
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras, including multiple dense layers, batch normalization, and dropout for regularization.
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - StandardScaler for numerical features, OneHotEncoder/FunctionTransformer for categorical features. The modelâ€™s performance is detailed in the repositoryâ€™s documentation or logs.
- **Model Evaluation**:

  | Metric              | Value    |
  | ------------------- | -------- |
  | Accuracy            | 0.8687   |
  | Precision (Churn=1) | 0.7513   |
  | Recall (Churn=1)    | 0.4863   |
  | F1-Score (Churn=1)  | 0.5904   |

  *Note: Values may vary slightly based on dataset splits and hyperparameters.*
